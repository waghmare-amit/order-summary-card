### What I learned

While working on this project, I faced alot of issue making the page responsive for 'Phone Landscape'; but later on I got to know how that is done using AI. Even though this page is not totally responsive with Phone Landscape but I've learned how to make one and from the next projects I will make sure the pages are well responsive for Phone Landscape.
